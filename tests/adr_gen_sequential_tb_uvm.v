// Write a UVM test for the sequential address generator (adr_gen_sequential).
// Especially make sure that the address generator works correctly with random
// stalls (meaning if adr_en goes low intermittently), that it resets properly, 
// and that it goes back to zero after reaching the maximum configured value.

// Your code starts here

// Your code ends here
